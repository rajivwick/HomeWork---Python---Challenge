# HomeWork---Python---Challenge
Module 3 Challenge - PyBank and PyPoll

This set out challenge required us to create two script to interpret and formulate over two different sets of data.

Attacking both of these scripts, I wanted to approach the construction of the code in a way that utilized functions, dictionaries and lists where and when possible. 
I also wanted to construct the code with the idea of future revisions in mind, incorporating a singular results list that was used to output both on the terminal and text file. This  meant that if, in future, the output needed to be changed - only a singular function has to be updated.
